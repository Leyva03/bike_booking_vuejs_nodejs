# bike_booking_vuejs_nodejs
This project simulates a bike booking portal, where each column represents a bike available for reservation and each row corresponds to a booking slot. Users can choose from five bikes, with five slots available for each bike, allowing multiple users to vie for the same bicycle. The server will allocate the bike to the last user who clicks on one of the bike's slots. Each bicycle operates independently.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest stable version recommended).
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Leyva03/bike_booking_vuejs_nodejs.git
   cd bike_booking_vuejs_nodejs/src
   ```

2. In one terminal, start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will open the frontend on a localhost.

3. In another terminal, run the Node.js backend:
   ```bash
   node exam.js
   ```
   This will also open on a localhost.

## Features

- Interactive bike booking interface with independent bike reservations.
